# romconv - ROM/bin file conversion

Arcade emulation involves dealing with the original ROM files of the
machines to be emulated. Sometimes the conversion is limited to the
transcription from binary to an equivalent C source file. But in many
cases the conversion includes further data processing. E.g. all color
tables are converted into the 16 bit color format used by the ILI9341
or ST7789 displays. Sprite and tile data is converted into a format
easier to process on the ESP32.

The conversion could be done on the ESP32 target at run time. But in
Galagino it's done beforehand. This offloads these tasks from the
ESP32.

It's possible to implement only one or two of all arcade
machines. In that case the related ROM conversion can be omitted and
the machine in question has to be disabled in the file
[config.h](../source/src/config.h).

The necessary ROM files need be placed in the [romszip
directory](../romszip) before these scripts can be run.

The logo conversion for the game selection menu might require the
seperate installation of the ```imageio python module``` which can
e.g. be done by the following command. This is usually not needed as
the logos are included pre-converted. This is only needed if you intend
the change the logos.

```pip3 install imageio```

## Do-it-all script

A [batch](conv__all.bat) is included that does all the conversion.
If you prefer to do everything manually, then use the instructions
below. Otherwise running the script is all you need to do.

## Do it step by step

Execute the following batch files:
conv_z80.bat

Execute the batch for each wanted game:

conv_1942.bat

conv_alibaba.bat

conv_amidar.bat

conv_anteater.bat

conv_bagman.bat

conv_bnj.bat

conv_bombjack.bat

conv_btime.bat

conv_circusc.bat

conv_crush.bat

conv_digdug.bat

conv_dkong.bat

conv_dkong3.bat

conv_dkongjr.bat

conv_eyes.bat

conv_fantasy.bat

conv_frogger.bat

conv_galaga.bat

conv_mspacman.bat

conv_nibbler.bat

conv_pacman.bat

conv_pbaction.bat

conv_pengo.bat

conv_phoenix.bat

conv_pooyan.bat

conv_rocnrope.bat

conv_scramble.bat

conv_scregg.bat

conv_starforce.bat

conv_supercobra.bat

conv_theglob.bat

conv_timeplt.bat

conv_todruaga.bat

conv_turtles.bat

conv_tutankhm.bat

conv_vanguard.bat

conv_vanvan.bat

conv_xevious.bat

The game conversion scripts also use Pillow and NumPy where required.
The supplied sample packs and WAV files must remain beside their converters.
The Z80 patch retains encrypted opcode fetching and keeps StepZ80 in flash.
