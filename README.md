# Galagino 3.2A a special LVL ESP32-2432S024 / ESP32-024 porting with enanched joystick and flyer oled display, with bluethooth support for external controller.
Also updated to support ESP32-024 CYD clone modules, see info below.

Galagino V3.2A software can be uploaded on V2.0 hardware without any modification.

UPDATE !!!!
Recently, some modules have been shipped that are clones of those used in the project and have a different display driver as well as different connections on the connectors.
If your module is one of these (ESP32-024)—and you’ll notice right away because when you upload the code, the screen will be rotated 90°—then you must use the latest version of the code, 3.2A, and follow the new wiring diagram 3.0A. You’ll also need to modify the definition for your display type in the config.h file.

Comment out the line:     // #define CHEAP_YELLOW_DISPLAY_CONF

And uncomment the line:   #define CHEAP_YELLOW_DISPLAY_CONF_ALT

Due to memory limitations, not all games can be enabled. Edit the config.h file to select which games to enable. At least two must always be disabled; otherwise, they won’t fit in the ESP32’s memory.
By default, Gyruss and Tutankham are disabled; they are still emulated but run too slowly to be playable.

Galagino uses code that is not freely available and thus not included in this repository. Preparing the firmware thus consists of a few additional steps:

* If you do not have Python installed, download it from here. [Python 3.13.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3130)
* The ROM ZIP files have to be placed in the [romszip directory](romszip/), together with the ZIP file containing the Z80 emulator.
* A set of [python scripts](romconv/) is then being used to convert and patch the ROM data and emulator code and to include the resulting code into the galagino machines directory. For all games, just use conv__all.bat.

The [ROM conversion](./romconv) create a whole bunch of additional files in the [source directory](./source). Please check the README in the [romconv](./romconv) directory for further instructions.
Please ensure that the stripts run without errors!

* Open src.INO with Arduino IDE
* Add this url in your arduino ide board source preferences: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ricardoquesada/esp32-arduino-lib-builder/master/bluepad32_files/package_esp32_bluepad32_index.json 
* then add a ESP32 bluepad board
* select board "ESP 32 DEV module" family:esp32_bluepad32
* Use huge partition
* Enable PSRAM


## Controls

* Joystick UP/DOWN to select game
* Any key to enter in the selected game.
* COIN key to add coins
* START key to start game or flight loop in 1945 game
* FIRE key to of a fire in game the uses fire/action
* COIN + UP/DOWN to setup volume
* COIN pressed for 10 second to enable/disable BT
* START for 5 seconds to exit game and return to selection menu
* FIRE during boot to access configuration menu

## Attract mode

In Attract mode, the machine cycles through all games if you do not touch the joystick. The games end after 5 minutes.
